# Space Arcade Multiplayer
 A space arcade multiplayer game inspired by Eric Matthes's alien invasion game. 
 This game is played by two players. One player uses an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense 
 Accelerometer to read X and Y coordinates to move the spaceship. The other player
 uses the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship. 
 The two players can shoot aliens that appear on the screen to upgrade their spaceship.
 The game is over once a player's life has reached below zero.
